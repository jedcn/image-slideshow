# Image Slideshow

Create a dynamic reveal.js presentation based on images returned from
a Google search result.

## Usage

Setup a functional ruby environment and run a `bundle`.

Next, think of a search term and run `reveal-ck generate`:

    $ reveal-ck generate
    Generating slides for 'slides.rb'..
    Search For: puppies

This takes about 3-5 seconds to complete.

When finished, a new reveal.js presentation will be available in the
`slides/` directory. Open `slides/index.html` in your favorite
browser.

If you're on MacOS, you can run `open slides/index.html`.
